## üìò About the Tool

**i-Detector** is an educational tool that leverages social engineering techniques to simulate Instagram login and 2FA mechanisms.  
This is the **initial version**, featuring a simple and practical design that will be updated over time.

### üìÇ Tool Content

Inside the `source code` folder, you will find all the necessary files required to run a **fake login page**.  
You can upload these files to any web server or hosting environment to start using the tool.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è To collect user input data, you will need a **separate data management script** which must run on your own device.

### üêç Data Management Tool

The data management tool is written in **Python** and is so easy to use that anyone can run it, regardless of technical background.  
It listens for login events and displays user-submitted credentials in real-time.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use the Data Management Tool (`run.py`)

The file `run.py` is the core of the data management system. It's written in Python and works on **Windows**, **Linux**, and **Termux (Android)** with internet access.

This script monitors the login activity on your fake page and displays the submitted data in real-time, allowing you to approve or reject each login attempt.
